# blocks ipelet

To actually use blocks in an Ipe document, you need the style file
"blocks.isy".

To place blocks, use a 16pt grid, enable grid snapping, turn on
"Marks", and select mark shape "block".

To place robots, you'll need to use an 8pt grid so you can place them
at the corners of the blocks.

To pivot a block, you need to select a block and all robots you want
to take along (it does not matter if you pick the robot on the pivot
joint).

The keys are:

```
Y U
H J
```
for rotating left

and
```
I O
K L
```
for rotating right

and use the key matching the joint of the pivoting block, i.e. Y for
top left or J for bottom right.
